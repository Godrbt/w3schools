                            <p style="text-align:justify">It is Garage Vaala's policy to respect your privacy regarding any
                                information we may collect while operating our website. This Privacy Policy applies to
                                www.garagevaala.com (hereinafter, "us", "we", or "www.garagevaala.com"). We respect your
                                privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide
                                us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain
                                what information may be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and under
                                what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy
                                applies only to information we collect through the Website and does not apply to our
                                collection of information from other sources.</p>

                            <p style="text-align:justify">This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms of service posted on
                                our Website, set forth the general rules and policies governing your use of our Website.
                                Depending on your activities when visiting our Website, you may be required to agree to
                                additional terms of service.</p>



                            <h5 style="text-align:justify">1. Website Visitors</h5>



                            <p style="text-align:justify">Like most website operators, Garage Vaala collects
                                non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically
                                make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date
                                and time of each visitor request. Garage Vaala's purpose in collecting non-personally
                                identifying information is to better understand how Garage Vaala's visitors use its website.
                                From time to time, Garage Vaala may release non-personally-identifying information in the
                                aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>

                            <p style="text-align:justify">Garage Vaala also collects potentially personally-identifying
                                information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving
                                comments on https://www.garagevaala.com blog posts. Garage Vaala only discloses logged in
                                user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses
                                personally-identifying information as described below.</p>



                            <h5 style="text-align:justify">2. Personally-Identifying Information</h5>



                            <p style="text-align:justify">Certain visitors to Garage Vaala's websites choose to interact
                                with Garage Vaala in ways that require Garage Vaala to gather personally-identifying
                                information. The amount and type of information that Garage Vaala gathers depends on the
                                nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who leave a comment at
                                https://www.garagevaala.com to provide a username and email address.</p>



                            <h5 style="text-align:justify">3. Security</h5>



                            <p style="text-align:justify">The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but
                                remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage
                                is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your
                                Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>



                            <h5 style="text-align:justify">4. Advertisements</h5>



                            <p style="text-align:justify">Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by
                                advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize
                                your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about
                                you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other
                                things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.
                                This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Garage Vaala and does not cover the use of
                                cookies by any advertisers.</p>



                            <h5 style="text-align:justify">5. Links To External Sites</h5>



                            <p style="text-align:justify">Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not
                                operated by us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third
                                party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy and terms of service of
                                every site you visit.<br>
                                We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or
                                practices of any third party sites, products or services.</p>



                            <h5 style="text-align:justify">6. Garage Vaala uses Google AdWords for remarketing</h5>



                            <p style="text-align:justify">Garage Vaala uses the remarketing services to advertise on third
                                party websites (including Google) to previous visitors to our site. It could mean that we
                                advertise to previous visitors who haven't completed a task on our site, for example using
                                the contact form to make an enquiry. This could be in the form of an advertisement on the
                                Google search results page, or a site in the Google Display Network. Third-party vendors,
                                including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on someone's past visits. Of course, any
                                data collected will be used in accordance with our own privacy policy and Google's privacy
                                policy.<br>
                                You can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the Google Ad Preferences
                                page, and if you want to you can opt out of interest-based advertising entirely by cookie
                                settings or permanently using a browser plugin.</p>



                            <h5 style="text-align:justify">7. Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h5>



                            <p style="text-align:justify">Garage Vaala discloses potentially personally-identifying and
                                personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and
                                affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on
                                Garage Vaala's behalf or to provide services available at Garage Vaala's website, and (ii)
                                that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and
                                affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Garage
                                Vaala's website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Garage Vaala will
                                not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information
                                to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as
                                described above, Garage Vaala discloses potentially personally-identifying and
                                personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other
                                governmental request, or when Garage Vaala believes in good faith that disclosure is
                                reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Garage Vaala, third parties or the
                                public at large.<br>
                                If you are a registered user of https://www.garagevaala.com and have supplied your email
                                address, Garage Vaala may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features,
                                solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Garage Vaala
                                and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we
                                expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a
                                support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in
                                order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.
                                Garage Vaala takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized
                                access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and
                                personally-identifying information.</p>



                            <h5 style="text-align:justify">8. Aggregated Statistics</h5>



                            <p style="text-align:justify">Garage Vaala may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors
                                to its website. Garage Vaala may display this information publicly or provide it to others.
                                However, Garage Vaala does not disclose your personally-identifying information.</p>



                            <h5 style="text-align:justify">9. Cookies</h5>



                            <p style="text-align:justify">To enrich and perfect your online experience, Garage Vaala uses
                                "Cookies", similar technologies and services provided by others to display personalized
                                content, appropriate advertising and store your preferences on your computer.<br>
                                A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that
                                the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Garage Vaala
                                uses cookies to help Garage Vaala identify and track visitors, their usage of
                                https://www.garagevaala.com, and their website access preferences. Garage Vaala visitors who
                                do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse
                                cookies before using Garage Vaala's websites, with the drawback that certain features of
                                Garage Vaala's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.<br>
                                By continuing to navigate our website without changing your cookie settings, you hereby
                                acknowledge and agree to Garage Vaala's use of cookies.</p>



                            <h5 style="text-align:justify">10. E-commerce</h5>



                            <p style="text-align:justify">Those who engage in transactions with Garage Vaala – by purchasing
                                Garage Vaala's services or products, are asked to provide additional information, including
                                as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions.
                                In each case, Garage Vaala collects such information only insofar as is necessary or
                                appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Garage Vaala. Garage
                                Vaala does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
                                And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat
                                that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>



                            <h5 style="text-align:justify">11. Business Transfers</h5>



                            <p style="text-align:justify">If Garage Vaala, or substantially all of its assets, were
                                acquired, or in the unlikely event that Garage Vaala goes out of business or enters
                                bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a
                                third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Garage
                                Vaala may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>
